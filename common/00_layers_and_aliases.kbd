    ;; switching over to this vim mode. maybe hold down both
    ;; thumbs at once. tab and return. that could be pretty fucking
    ;; cool actually which would mean that you enter some kind
    ;; temp layer which you then use to switch over so that you don't
    ;; need to hold down a finger all the time which is super annoying
    ;; and so that is the reason why it is so fucking awesome at the
    ;; moment
